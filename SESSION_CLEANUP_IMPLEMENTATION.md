# Session Cleanup Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of comprehensive session cleanup when users log out from the EasyShare application.

## Problem

Previously, the application only cleaned up session data when:
- Socket disconnected (network issues, browser close)
- Periodic cleanup (every 5 minutes)
- Manual force disconnect

There was **no cleanup when users explicitly logged out** via Clerk's authentication system.

## Why Session Cleanup is Necessary

### Security Reasons
- Prevents session data from being accessible if someone else uses the same device
- Removes sensitive user information from Redis storage
- Ensures proper session termination on logout

### Privacy Reasons
- User explicitly chose to log out, expecting their session to be cleared
- Respects user intent for complete session termination

### Data Integrity
- Prevents stale session data that could cause confusion if user logs back in
- Ensures clean state for subsequent logins

### Performance
- Reduces Redis memory usage by removing unused session data
- Prevents accumulation of orphaned session records

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced UserSessionService

**New Method: `cleanupUserLogout(userId: string)`**

Performs comprehensive cleanup including:
- Remove user socket mapping
- Remove socket data
- Clear typing indicators
- Clear user activity tracking
- Clear cached user data (session, presence, status)

```typescript
// Location: src/services/UserSessionService.ts
async cleanupUserLogout(userId: string): Promise<void>
```

### 2. Logout API Endpoint

**New Endpoint: `POST /api/logout`**

- Handles logout cleanup requests
- Removes user from current room if applicable
- Triggers comprehensive session cleanup
- Can be called with or without authentication context

```typescript
// Location: src/app/api/logout/route.ts
export async function POST(req: NextRequest)
```

### 3. Socket Event Handling

**New Socket Event: `user:logout`**

- Added to `ClientToServerEvents` interface
- Handles server-side logout processing
- Notifies other room participants
- Sends system message about user logout

```typescript
// Location: src/app/api/socket/route.ts
socket.on('user:logout', async (userId) => {
  // Server-side logout handling
});
```

### 4. Client-Side Logout Detection

**Enhanced SocketProvider**

- Detects when Clerk user changes from authenticated to null
- Automatically triggers logout cleanup
- Emits logout event to socket server
- Clears local React state
- Disconnects socket connection

```typescript
// Location: src/components/providers/SocketProvider.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Detect logout and perform cleanup
}, [user, socket]);
```

## Session Data Cleaned Up

When a user logs out, the following data is removed:

### Redis Keys Removed
- `user_socket:{userId}` - User to socket mapping
- `socket_data:{socketId}` - Socket session data
- `user_activity:{userId}` - Activity tracking
- `user_session:{userId}` - User session cache
- `user_presence:{userId}` - Presence information
- `user_status:{userId}` - Status information
- Typing indicators for all rooms
- Active users set membership

### Local State Cleared
- Current room information
- Messages history
- Participants list
- Typing indicators
- Socket connection

## Flow Diagram

```
User Clicks Logout (Clerk UserButton)
              ↓
    Clerk sets user to null
              ↓
  SocketProvider detects logout
              ↓
   Emit 'user:logout' to server  ←→  Server handles logout event
              ↓                        ↓
   Call /api/logout endpoint     Remove from room & notify others
              ↓                        ↓
    Clean local React state      Comprehensive session cleanup
              ↓                        ↓
   Disconnect socket            Socket disconnection
              ↓
    User redirected to login
```

## Testing the Implementation

### Manual Testing
1. Login to the application
2. Join or create a room
3. Check Redis for session data
4. Click logout via UserButton
5. Verify session data is cleaned up
6. Check that other users are notified

### What to Verify
- [ ] Session data removed from Redis
- [ ] User removed from room participants
- [ ] Other users see logout notification
- [ ] Local state cleared
- [ ] Socket properly disconnected
- [ ] Clean login experience on re-login

## Configuration

No additional configuration required. The implementation uses existing:
- Redis connection
- Clerk authentication
- Socket.io setup
- Existing service factories

## Monitoring

Logout cleanup activities are logged with:
- `=== USER LOGOUT DETECTED ===`
- `=== CLEANING UP USER LOGOUT ===`
- `SUCCESS: User logout cleanup completed`

Monitor these logs to ensure proper functionality.

## Conclusion

This implementation ensures that user session data is properly cleaned up when users explicitly log out, addressing security, privacy, and performance concerns while maintaining a clean user experience.
